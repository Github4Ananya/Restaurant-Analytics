# Restaurant-Analytics:Ratings Prediction Recommendations and Cuisine Classification


# 1. Predict Restaurant Ratings
Objective:
Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features.

Overview:
This task involves developing a regression model to predict restaurant ratings. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting it into training and testing sets. A regression algorithm, such as linear regression or decision tree regression, is selected and trained on the processed data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. The results are analyzed to identify the most influential features impacting restaurant ratings.

# 2. Restaurant Recommendation System
Objective:
Create a recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences.

Overview:
This task focuses on implementing a content-based filtering approach to recommend restaurants that align with users' specific preferences, such as cuisine type or price range. The dataset is first preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. The recommendation system is then designed to provide personalized suggestions by comparing user preferences with restaurant attributes. The effectiveness of the recommendation system is tested and evaluated through sample user scenarios.

# 3. Cuisine Classification
Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants by their cuisine types.

Overview:
In this task, a classification model is created to categorize restaurants based on their cuisine. The data is prepared by handling missing values and encoding categorical features before being split into training and testing sets. A suitable classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forest, is selected and trained. The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The analysis also explores the model's effectiveness across different cuisine categories and addresses any potential biases or challenges.
